## Overview
### Description
[Description of your app]
"Duolingo For Code" aims to help those interested in coding learn fundamentals that all high level coding languages adhere to (OOP, Data Structures, Searching Algorithms). Expanding on these ideas for real world applications that can make coding fun and interactive for the user. (early implementation will focus on multiple choice checks on user knowledge, while later implementation could encourage users to write their own code and have it compiled and tested in app) The end goal of this app is for users to feel confident in these larger coding topics and have the tools to apply them in later projects. Could extend further into learning git for project management, working with frameworks that support web dev, and project ideas to help other people get started with basic implementation of web based apps.

* Each module has separate lessons to build up understanding (new screen once clicked)
aiming for at least 3-4 modules, want each module to contain at least ~ (an hour) of content
